# LecternBook

LecternBook allows you to read books you have placed on a lectern by simply clicking the left mouse button.

## How it works

If you have placed a written book on a lectern, you can start reading it through the chat by left-clicking on the lectern. If you want to view another page of the book placed on the lectern you clicked on with the left mouse button, look at the lectern and execute the command /page [page number].
